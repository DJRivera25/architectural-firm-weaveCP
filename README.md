## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Status & Room for Improvement

- **Frontend currently uses mock data** for all content, team, jobs, etc. (for rapid prototyping)
- **Backend is fully CMS-ready**: all endpoints, models, and utilities are production-grade and type-safe
- **Next steps:**
  - Connect frontend components to API endpoints (replace mock data)
  - Build admin UI for content, team, job, and image management
  - Add password reset, analytics, advanced search, and reporting endpoints as needed
  - Expand Cloudinary image resource typing as needed
  - Add public portfolio endpoints if required

## üìù Notes

- This app is **in progress**. The backend is production-ready, but the frontend is still using mock data for all content and management features.
- All new features should use strict typing and follow the established API/utilities pattern.
- For improvements, see the "Room for Improvement" section above.
